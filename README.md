# The physics of fluids
*Objectives of the course:* the lecture presents a broad overview of fluid mechanics at all scales, from bacterias to stars. Through worked-out examples, the fundamentals of flow modelling are introduced:
* key concepts (boundary layers, waves and flow instabilities),
* physical mechanisms (diffusive/convective fluxes, vortex induction),
* techniques (scale invariance and thin films), and
* approaches (quick order of magnitude estimates vs more refined asymptotic analyses).

After a review of hydrodynamics fundamentals (conservation laws and boundary conditions), the lecture strolls through two main themes, low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics and inertia-dominated flows. A particular focus on thin films allows for a description of flows as diverse as the relaxation of micron-thick viscous polymer melts up to planet-sized atmospherical flows.
